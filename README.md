## Welcome!
This is the repository for *FIRST* Tech Challenge Team *9873 Pikatech*. This was the competition code we used to reach finals at LA Regionals, as well as win the League C1 + E Interleague Tournament. It is based off of the official FTC app (https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app). If you need any help with programming, please feel free to contact us at ftc9873@gmail.com or william.trangg@gmail.com. We'd be happy to help!

## Disclaimer
Because this was the working project, we do not officially support any software in here unless specified. However we still welcome bug reports and feedback on this repository so we can catch bugs!
