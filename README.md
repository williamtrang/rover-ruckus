## Welcome!
This is the working repository for *FIRST* Tech Challenge Team *9873 Pikatech*. This is our competition robot code, as well as some of our tests for features that we want to add. It is based off of the official FTC app (https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app). If you need any help with programming, please feel free to contact us at ftc9873@gmail.com or william.trangg@gmail.com. We'd be happy to help!

## Disclaimer
Because this is the working project, we do not officially support any software in here unless specified. However we still welcome bug reports and feedback on this repository so we can catch bugs!
