# Welcome!
This is the repository for *FIRST* Tech Challenge Team 9873 Pikatech, and is specifically made for the 2018-2019 *FIRST* Tech Challenge game Rover Ruckus. In this repository, you will find all of our autonomous programs and tele-op programs for this year's game, located in TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode. This repository will be constantly updated throughout the year, so stay tuned. Everything aside from TeamCode is copied from the official FTC app's repository (https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app). If you are a *FIRST* Tech Challenge team that needs help, or are just looking around, feel free to contact us at ftc9873@gmail.com and william.trangg@gmail.com.
